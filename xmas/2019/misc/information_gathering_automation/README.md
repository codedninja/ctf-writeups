# Information Gathering Automation
## Challenge
>Our agency wants to collect information related to the next line-up of entertainment objects that are currently being built by Santa's gnome team. We noticed that the factory only trusts Discord bots to enter, so we need you to create an Information Gathering Automaton in order to collect the factory's secrets.

## How to solve
To solve this challenge you had to create an Discord bot using a library and using the function they provide, find the flag in history of a channel.

## Solution
[bot.js](bot.js)
